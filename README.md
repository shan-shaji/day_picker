## Usage

Add `day_picker` to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    day_picker: 2.2.0
```

import the package:

```dart
import 'package:day_picker/day_picker.dart';
```

Constructor for the `day_picker` is given below.

```dart
    SelectWeekDays({
    required this.onSelect,
    this.backgroundColor,
    this.fontWeight,
    this.fontSize,
    this.daysFillColor,
    this.daysBorderColor,
    this.selectedDayTextColor,
    this.unSelectedDayTextColor,
    this.border = true,
    this.boxDecoration,
    this.padding = 8.0,
    required this.days,
    Key? key,
  }) : super(key: key);
```

Example here creates a `day_picker` with below style [with Gradient and no borders].

```dart

    List<DayInWeek> _days = [
    DayInWeek(
      "Sun",
    ),
    DayInWeek(
      "Mon",
    ),
    DayInWeek(
      "Tue",
      isSelected: true
    ),
    DayInWeek(
      "Wed",
    ),
    DayInWeek(
      "Thu",
    ),
    DayInWeek(
      "Fri",
    ),
    DayInWeek(
      "Sat",
    ),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Select days in week"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
          child: SelectWeekDays(
            fontSize: 14,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
            days: _days,
            border: false,
            boxDecoration: BoxDecoration(
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30.0),
              gradient: LinearGradient(
                begin: Alignment.topLeft,
                colors: [const Color(0xFFE55CE4), const Color(0xFFBB75FB)],
                tileMode:
                TileMode.repeated, // repeats the gradient over the canvas
              ),
            ),
            onSelect: (values) { // <== Callback to handle the selected days
              print(values);
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
```

Pass a callback to the `onSelect` property with parameter of type `List<String>`.

---

Pass a list of days of type `DayInWeek` into `days` property

```dart
class DayInWeek {
  String dayName;
  bool isSelected = false;

  DayInWeek(this.dayName, {this.isSelected = false});
}
```

`DayInWeek` consist of two Properties [dayName] and [isSelected].
By default [isSelected] value will be `false`

---

Example:

```dart
void handleOnSelect(List<String> value){
    //TODO: Manipulate the List of days selected
    print(value);
}
```

| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| onSelect               | List`<String>`  | Callback invoked when days are selected                                                                              |
| days |   List`<DayInWeek>` | List of days that need to be passed
| padding                | `double`        | Padding between container and the buttons [by default it is 8.0]                                                     |
| boxdecoration          | `BoxDecoration` | provides variety of ways to style the background container[gradient, color, border radius]                           |
| backgroundColor        | `Color`         | Property to change the color of the container                                                                        |
| fontSize               | `double`     | Property to change size of font                                                                     |
| fontWeight             | `FontWeight`    | Property to change the font weight of text                                             |

| selectedDayTextColor   | `Color`         | property to change the text color of the selected days                                                               |

| border                 | `bool`          | Set this property to false if border is not needed around the rounded buttons[by default this property will be true] |

With the implementation of the `setDaysState` method, developers can dynamically modify which days are selected within their application's code, even after the `SelectWeekDays` widget has already been constructed. 
By utilizing the Global Key that is passed into the widget, one can easily update the selected dates as desired.
