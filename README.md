## Usage

Add `day_picker` to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    day_picker: 2.3.0
```

import the package:

```dart
import 'package:day_picker/day_picker.dart';
```

Constructor for the `day_picker` is given below.

```dart
      const SelectWeekDays({
        required this.onSelect,
        required this.days,
        this.backgroundColor,
        this.fontWeight,
        this.fontSize,
        this.selectedDaysFillColor,
        this.unselectedDaysFillColor,
        this.selectedDaysBorderColor,
        this.unselectedDaysBorderColor,
        this.selectedDayTextColor,
        this.unSelectedDayTextColor,
        this.border = true,
        this.boxDecoration,
        this.padding = 8.0,
        this.width,
        this.borderWidth,
        this.elevation = 2.0,
        super.key,
      });
```

Example here creates a `day_picker` with below style [with Gradient and no borders].

```dart

  final List<DayInWeek> _days = [
    DayInWeek("Zo", dayKey: "monday"),
    DayInWeek("Ma", dayKey: "tuesday"),
    DayInWeek("Di", dayKey: "wednesday"),
    DayInWeek("Wo", dayKey: "thursday"),
    DayInWeek("Do", dayKey: "friday"),
    DayInWeek("Vr", dayKey: "saturday", isSelected: true),
    DayInWeek("Za", dayKey: "sunday", isSelected: true),
  ];

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text("Select days in week"),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
          child: SelectWeekDays(
            key: customWidgetKey,
            fontSize: 14,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
            days: _days,
            border: false,
            width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 1.4,
            boxDecoration: BoxDecoration(
              color: Colors.red,
              borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(30.0),
            ),
            onSelect: (values) {
              print(values);
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
```

Pass a callback to the `onSelect` property with parameter of type `List<String>`.

---

Pass a list of days of type `DayInWeek` into `days` property

```dart
class DayInWeek {
  DayInWeek(
      this.dayName, {
        required this.dayKey,
        this.isSelected = false,
      });

  String dayName;
  String dayKey;
  bool isSelected = false;
}
```

`DayInWeek` consist of three Properties [dayName], [dayKey] and [isSelected].
By default [isSelected] value will be `false`

---

Example:

```dart
void handleOnSelect(List<String> days){
    //TODO: Manipulate the List of days selected
    print(days);
}
```

| days |   List`<DayInWeek>` | List of days that need to be passed
| padding                | `double`        | Padding between container and the buttons [by default it is 8.0]                                                     |

| fontSize               | `double`     | Property to change size of font                                                                     |
| fontWeight             | `FontWeight`    | Property to change the font weight of text                                             |

| border                 | `bool`          | Set this property to false if border is not needed around the rounded buttons[by default this property will be true] |

With the implementation of the `setDaysState` method, developers can dynamically modify which days are selected within their application's code, even after the `SelectWeekDays` widget has already been constructed. 
By utilizing the Global Key that is passed into the widget, one can easily update the selected dates as desired.
